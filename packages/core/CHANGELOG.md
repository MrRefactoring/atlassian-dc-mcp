# Change Log

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`7ac1a1f`](https://github.com/MrRefactoring/atlassian-dc-mcp/commit/7ac1a1fae2d1b9e3f19293f95bbe3ef67e51de1b) Thanks [@MrRefactoring](https://github.com/MrRefactoring)! - Lift the HTTP client core into `datacenter-mcp-core` so every product package shares one implementation. `createHttpClient`, the `route` tagged-template URL builder, `pickBody`, `bindGroup`, `ApiError`, and the client interfaces (`HttpClient`, `SendRequestOptions`, `HttpClientConfig`, …) now live in and are exported from core; a new `responseType: 'arraybuffer'` mode returns the raw bytes for binary downloads, and a new `softValidation` config flag validates responses non-fatally (a schema mismatch logs a warning and passes the raw body through instead of throwing) for clients whose schemas aren't yet fully verified against a live instance. Response parsing also tolerates an empty body on a 200/201 that still advertises a JSON `Content-Type` (some mutation endpoints answer this way), returning `undefined` instead of throwing on `JSON.parse('')`. The Bitbucket client drops its local copies and imports these from core, with no change to its behavior or exposed tools.

### Patch Changes

- [`9126faa`](https://github.com/MrRefactoring/atlassian-dc-mcp/commit/9126faaf28d181f1d80d629682fd85a17830c939) Thanks [@MrRefactoring](https://github.com/MrRefactoring)! - Make every `index.ts` a pure barrel (re-exports only). Each product's tool-registration/bootstrap entry moves from `src/index.ts` to `src/server.ts` (imported by the `run.ts` bin dispatcher and the start/dev/inspect scripts), and `src/index.ts` becomes a barrel over the service, config, and mappers. In core, the `createMcpServer`/`connectServer`/`formatToolResponse` runtime moves to `src/server.ts` and `index.ts` re-exports it, so the `datacenter-mcp-core` public API is unchanged. No change to the `npx <product>-datacenter-mcp [setup]` command or server behavior.

- [`d220a9e`](https://github.com/MrRefactoring/atlassian-dc-mcp/commit/d220a9ee0eff2e006f8b44d262d6a697b1a25884) Thanks [@MrRefactoring](https://github.com/MrRefactoring)! - Improve npm discoverability: mention Claude/AI assistants in package descriptions and add search keywords (mcp-server, claude, claude-desktop, anthropic, ai, llm, and product-specific aliases like jira-server/confluence-server/bitbucket-server).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`582a094`](https://github.com/MrRefactoring/atlassian-dc-mcp/commit/582a094960ba6d74453aabefa4ed44522ac07351) Thanks [@MrRefactoring](https://github.com/MrRefactoring)! - Allow the MCP servers to start and run without an API token, for Data Center instances that permit anonymous access. `*_API_TOKEN` is no longer required by config validation or the interactive `setup` CLI; when it's absent, requests are sent with no `Authorization` header instead of the previous placeholder-token workaround.
